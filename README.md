# gitmyweek

A simple command line tool to show a summary of your Git commits.

To use

`go build`

`./gitmyweek -dir="Path/To/Development/Dir" -author="Github Username"`

This tool only works if you have all of your Git repos in one directory. For example I have all of mine in `~/Development`.

So I would do `./gitmyweek -dir="/Users/dylanmitchell/Development" -author="dylan-mitchell"`
